# VoidWorld
A simple Minecraft Void World config pack for the Terra world generation platform.

This pack aims to be as simplistic as possible only containing one biome yaml and the required pack yaml.  There is a 3x3 bedrock platform at 0,0 for ease of use, otherwise the entire world is a void.  Perfect for building or other projects where terrain is unnecessary.
